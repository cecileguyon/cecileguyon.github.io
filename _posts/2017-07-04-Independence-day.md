Sooo after spending half the day looking for an effective note taking app, I decided that I might just write blog post here instead.
```python
import time 
import numpy as np
```

It's not that bad to write short articles about things I've played a bit with and summarize some ideas and notes for later. Plus if it can benefit anyone, it's ever better! :)
